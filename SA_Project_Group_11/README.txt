You can input any float data for A and B values provided both should not be zero so this is 
case when we can rotate member between node P and Q with our desired direction.

Other values of length should be greater than zero. In case you don't want to put that
member then put that length tending to zero but not exactly zero so that we can easily compute 
approximate value.

Loading could be any float variable of your choice.
In case you want to reverse direction then put magnitude with negative sign.
If don't want to put loading then simply put zero.

In material property, All three A, E and I should be positive and greater than zero.

If you will not follow above rules then corresponding error will be shown on that input field
and will not able to go to further pages unless and until you don't provide a valid range input. 

Put values according to indicated instruction so that program will able to show correct answer.
